to use the skyboxs simply drag-and-drop into your scene or open the lighting tab and replace the skybox material.
Things you might want to adjust for your scene is the intensity and the exposure.
I also recommend going to edit>project settings>player tab and changing the color space to Linear for better light
accuracy.

On the occasion of a bad import and skyboxs are dissociated:
	Select the hdr and in the inspector change Texture Shape to Cube
	Create new Material and change it to Skybox/Cubemap
	Then drag and drop into the scene


For Mobile switch the Six-sided Skybox's shader from Skybox/6 Sided to Moblie/Skybox
